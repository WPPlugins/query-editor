Adds a simple set of options to modify the default query by changing what post types are used, the ordering and more.

== Description ==

Adds a simple set of options to modify the default query. Be careful, this affects all list type
pages on the site and not just the home page.

You can:

 * Customise the post types used
 * Exclude terms from any taxonomy
 * Change the ordering
 * Set an offset to skip posts
 * Turn paging off
 * Use a simple meta query
